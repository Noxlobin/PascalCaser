## PascalCaser

A simple but handy tool for making space-separated sentences into PascalCase. In the TypeScript file, it only took around 50 lines of code.

### How it works

Open the website, and input your sentences (should be space separated), and it should translate it into PascalCase.

### Install

Copy the git repo:

```git

  git clone https://github.com/Noxlobin/PascalCaser.git

```

**Optional**: Recompile the typescript:

- Remove the `dist/` folder:

```bash

  rm -rf dist

```

- Install typescript globally:

```bash

  pnpm add typescript -g

```

- Recompile and run:

```bash

  tsc

```
